## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and fine-tuned models for the doctoral dissertation, "Emotions in the Identity of Paul." The project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze emotional expression in the Pauline Epistles. The core of this work is a custom-trained transformer model, fine-tuned on a bespoke dataset of Koine Greek, to classify texts according to Plutchik‚Äôs wheel of emotions.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

-   **/data**: Contains the raw and processed datasets used for training.
    -   `raw`: The initial 884 samples curated from the Louw-Nida lexicon.
    -   `processed`: The final, augmented dataset of 2,616 samples.
-   **/src**: Includes all Python source code.
    -   `/augmentation`: Scripts for data augmentation (back-translation, generative).
    -   `/training`: Scripts for fine-tuning the models.
    -   `/inference`: A script (`predict.py`) for running predictions on new text.
-   `requirements.txt`: A list of all necessary Python packages.

## ü§ñ Models

This study developed two primary models for different levels of textual analysis:

1.  **Emotion Classifier**
    -   **Task**: An 8-class classifier for Plutchik's basic emotions (Joy, Trust, Fear, Surprise, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, Anticipation).
    -   **Performance**: Achieved a **Macro F1 score of 0.660** on the validation set.
    -   **Status**: Complete. Model weights are available in `/models/emotion_classifier`.

2.  **Valence Analyzer**
    -   **Task**: A binary classifier for sentiment polarity (Positive/Negative).
    -   **Purpose**: To provide a broader sentiment overview, complementing the granular emotion analysis.
    -   **Status**: In development.

The final model weights are not stored in this repository due to their size. They are publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub.

## üíæ Dataset

The model was trained on a custom dataset of 2,616 annotated sentences in Koine Greek. The creation process involved:
1.  **Initial Curation**: A "golden standard" corpus of 884 samples was manually created based on the semantic domains of the Louw-Nida lexicon.
2.  **Data Augmentation**: To overcome the low-resource nature of Ancient Greek, the dataset was expanded using back-translation and generative augmentation via a large language model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-Repository-URL]
    cd [repository-folder]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Training

To replicate the training process for the emotion classifier, run the training script with the optimal hyperparameters:

```bash
python src/training/train_emotion_classifier.py --epochs 25 --learning_rate 5e-5
```

### Inference

To predict the emotion of a new Koine Greek sentence, use the `predict.py` script:

```bash
python src/inference/predict.py --text "·Ω¶ ·ºÄŒΩœåŒ∑œÑŒøŒπ ŒìŒ±ŒªŒ¨œÑŒ±Œπ"
```
**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Predicted Emotion: Anger

--- Probability Distribution ---
Anger: 0.8521
Disgust: 0.0893
...
```

## üìä Results

The final emotion classification model achieved a **Macro F1 score of 0.660**, a highly competitive result that demonstrates the model's robust capability within the methodologically demanding domain of a low-resource ancient language.
